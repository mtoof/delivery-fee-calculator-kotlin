# Wolt assignment 2024 ðŸš€
This is my solution for [Wolt Internship assignment 2024](https://github.com/woltapp/engineering-internship-2024) using Kotlin Spring boot.
<br>Previously I did the same assignment using [FastAPI](https://github.com/mtoof/delivery-fee-calculator) and this time I did it using Kotlin Spring Boot.

## How to run
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have Java 21, docker, Make and Git installed</li>
    
<li>Clone the repository</li>
    
<li>Run the following command

```shell
make  // This will build the project using gradle, build the docker image and run the server.
```
</li>

<li>The server will be running on `localhost:8080`</li>

<li>You can test the API using the Postman app or the following curl command

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/cart -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"cart_value\": 720, \"delivery_distance\": 2235, \"number_of_items\": 4, \"time\": \"2024-01-15T13:00:00Z\"}"
```
Should return
```json
{
    "delivery_fee": 780
}
```
</li>
</ol>

## How to run test units
```shell
make test
```

## How to stop
1. Run the following command
```shell
make down // This will stop the server and remove the container
make clean // This will remove the docker image
```
